"""The briefing's pending-question count must come from ONE predicate.

Regression test for a drift found 2026-07-28: check-pending-questions.py counted
33 waiting questions while morning-briefing.py counted 32, because the briefing
re-implemented the predicate. The entry it dropped was a live owner ask titled

    "/observe MVP: design fully resolved, build on your nod"

skipped by a `'RESOLVED' in title.upper()` substring test — the word appears in
the prose describing the *design*, not as a status marker. The same substring
test also fires on "NOT self-resolved", which says the opposite of resolved.

An open question that goes uncounted goes unsurfaced, so this asserts both that
the specific title survives AND that the two modules agree on a shared corpus.
Test 3 is the control: it fails against the old duplicated implementation.

## 2026-07-24T10:45Z — /observe MVP: design fully resolved, build on your nod
001 answered all 4 open design questions. **Non-blocking ask: nod and I build it.**

## 2026-07-20 — symlinks: NOT self-resolved
Still open despite the word appearing in the title.

## 2026-07-26T22:05Z — a plain open question
- **Status:** unanswered

## 2026-07-27T01:0xZ — an entry explicitly marked done
- **Status:** resolved

## ACTIVE — 2026-07-05 [organizer header, not a question]
Grouping shell.

## [RESOLVED 2026-07-03] shipped already
An inline resolution MARKER in the ACTIVE region — above the divider, no Status
field. Both consumers must agree it is not waiting.

## [RESOLVED?] Did this actually ship?
Question punctuation is NOT a resolution. This is an open uncertainty and must
survive on both surfaces (review [P1] 2026-07-28: `(?![\w-])` let `?` through,
so an open ask was classified resolved and vanished from notifier AND briefing).

## [DONE?] Still waiting for confirmation
Same shape, second keyword.

## HELD deployment until the owner approves the migration
- **Status:** open

A real ask whose title merely BEGINS with an organizer keyword. `^HELD\\b` treated
it as a section shell and deleted it from both surfaces (review 2026-07-28).
An organizer shell is a keyword plus a SEPARATOR, never a sentence.

## Confirm whether the UI should render a [DONE] badge
- **Status:** open

A question ABOUT a marker. Searching for `[DONE]` anywhere in the title matched
it; a resolution marker must LEAD the title or it is not a marker.

# Resolved

## 2026-07-20T13:14Z — ✅ RESOLVED — this lives below the divider
Must never be counted.
