"""Ingestion-level before/after for the progress-stream placeholder guard (#2157).

The fix drops a peer node's "⏳ <step> (Ns)" progress placeholders at task
INGESTION (in `_handle_discord_message`) so they don't each become a fresh task
(a self-inflicted flood). This proves the drop happens at the ingestion path,
not just in the detector:

  AFTER (placeholder channel msg): _handle_discord_message returns early, writes
                                   NO task, logs "[skip] progress-stream placeholder".
  Contrast (a real task msg):      is_progress_placeholder() is False, so the guard
                                   does NOT drop it — it proceeds past the guard.
