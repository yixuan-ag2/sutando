"""`_send_reply` must REPORT delivery — exercised for real, not stubbed out.

The sibling test (`slack-proactive-release-on-failure.test.py`) replaces
`_send_reply` with a True/False/raising stub. That proves the CALLER reacts to
the boolean correctly, and nothing about the helper that produces it. @john-the-dev
demonstrated the gap on #2627 by mutating the helper's final `return delivered_ok`
to an unconditional `True`: the behavioural test and the structural suite both
stayed green, because neither one ever runs the helper.

So this file stubs ONLY the Slack SDK surface (`app.client.chat_postMessage`,
`_send_file`) and calls the real `_send_reply`. `test_the_mutation_is_caught`
below is the reason it exists: it pins the exact mutation that survived.

Also covers the attachment-only warning branches. A body of just
`[file: /path]` posts no text chunk, so the deny / not-found notice is the ONLY
user-visible output. Those two `except` handlers used to `pass`, leaving
`delivered_ok` True — so a refused notice was reported as delivered and the
caller consumed the source. Fixed in this PR; asserted here.

HERMETIC, and it proves it: the operator's real `results/` is snapshotted
before the import and compared after.
