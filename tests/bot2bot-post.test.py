"""Tests for skills/bot2bot-post/post.py — the bot2bot-channel scope guard.

Regression for the 2026-07-27 dead-letter: `bot2bot-post --to <X>` silently
posted to the bot2bot channel even when X wasn't a member there, so the ping
went nowhere. bot2bot-post only posts to that one channel; the guard makes it
REFUSE a recipient who isn't a member (and thus the bot-vs-human-owner id
mix-up), instead of dead-lettering. Where to route a non-bot2bot message is the
caller's judgment — the guard doesn't prescribe a destination.

(Ids/names below are generic placeholders — this is shared-repo code.)

Run: python3 tests/bot2bot-post.test.py   (exit 0 pass / non-zero on failure)
