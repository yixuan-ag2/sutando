"""discord-read.py must render FORWARDED message content, not a blank line.

A Discord forward carries empty top-level `content`; the payload lives in
`message_snapshots[0].message`. `discord-bridge.py` already reads that shape and
`discord_addressee.py` documents it — the READER did not, so every forwarded
message printed as an empty body.

That reader is what the context-reconstruct step runs on every pass, so the gap
is silent and systemic: any decision forwarded into a channel rather than typed
was invisible.

Measured 2026-07-31 in #research-eval: two forwards rendered blank while holding
the only record of a live AMA failure (a 1,602-char session transcript plus the
reporter's own words). They were nearly deleted on the strength of that blank
output.
