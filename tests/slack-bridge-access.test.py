"""
Structural regression test for the Slack bridge access control (PR #867 / #866).

Guards that refactors of src/slack-bridge.py don't accidentally drop the
TOFU + allowlist gate, which is the only thing keeping a Slack bot from
processing tasks for arbitrary senders once it's installed.

Same scope as tests/discord-bridge-access-tier.test.py: STRUCTURAL —
regex-matches the source. Does NOT import the bridge (slack_bolt dep is
optional + heavy). Run manually:

    python3 tests/slack-bridge-access.test.py

Guards:
  1. `load_allowed()` returns None when ACCESS_FILE is missing (the
     None-vs-empty-set distinction TOFU relies on).
  2. `tofu_onboard()` exists, is gated on `ACCESS_FILE.exists()`, and
     writes the file at 0o600 perms (don't leak the owner's Slack user ID
     world-readable via umask 644).
  3. `_write_task()` checks `user_id not in allowed` and drops with a log
     line — fail-closed for unknown senders.
  4. ACCESS_FILE lives under $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/slack/ via the
     shared `claude_home_path()` helper — consistent with telegram + discord
     (so /sutando uninstall scripts find it across vanilla + claude-sutando).
