"""Regression test: check_quota_telemetry must surface a proxy that is up but
producing no quota state.

The gap it covers: quota-state.json is written by the credential proxy from
upstream response headers, so it only appears if a core actually ROUTES
through the proxy. src/startup.sh is the only thing exporting
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7846, and a supervisor-launched core
never runs startup.sh. On such a host the proxy is healthy and listening,
every check is green, and quota telemetry is silently absent forever — the
proactive loop's budget check reads "unknown" every pass with no explanation.

The pre-existing credential-proxy check cannot catch this: it is a plain
TCP-listening probe (correct for a forwarding proxy with no liveness
endpoint), so "listening" is the most it can ever assert.

Run: python3 tests/health-check-quota-telemetry.test.py
Exit: 0 on pass, 1 on fail.
