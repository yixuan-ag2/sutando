"""Regression test for the Chrome-onboarding seed interpreter resolution in
start-cli.sh (sonichi#2433 review, marklysze blocker).

The seed that writes `hasCompletedClaudeInChromeOnboarding` runs an inline
python. On a FRESH Mac there is no real system `python3` — bare `python3`
resolves to Apple's Xcode-CLT stub, which prints an "install developer tools"
notice and returns nothing. If the seed uses bare `python3` (guarded by
`command -v python3`, which the stub satisfies), the seed silently no-ops on
exactly the fresh-Mac environment it exists to repair — the detached core then
hangs at the Chrome acknowledgement prompt and "Say hello" times out.

The fix resolves the interpreter into `$PY` (SUTANDO_PY → bundled
`<engine>/runtime/python` → system python3) and uses `"$PY"` for the seed, with
a `"$PY" -c 'import sys'` guard (proves it RUNS, not just that a name exists).

This test is SOURCE-TIED, not a full launch of start-cli.sh: it extracts the
seed's PY heredoc verbatim from the script and reproduces the script's own
resolver + guard in a small shell harness, then runs the extracted seed under a
simulated clean-Mac env — a working interpreter in SUTANDO_PY, and a `python3`
stub on PATH that mimics the CLT shim (emits the notice, returns nothing, exit
1). It asserts the seed writes `hasCompletedClaudeInChromeOnboarding: true`.

Drift is caught by `_resolver_and_guard_snippet()` and the verbatim heredoc
extraction — if start-cli.sh's resolver, guard, or seed block changes shape,
those assertions fail. If the guard regresses to bare `python3`, the stub wins on
PATH under the reproduced harness and the flag is never written — the test fails.
(A full end-to-end launch is avoided so the run stays hermetic and fast — it
would spawn tmux/claude and need a real bundled runtime tree.)
