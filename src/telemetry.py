"""Anonymous, opt-out product telemetry for Sutando (PostHog).

Sutando is open source; the desktop app runs the same core. Instrumenting the
core (not just the app) lets maintainers see how many people run Sutando and
which features they use — WITHOUT ever collecting who they are or what they do.

What is sent
------------
Only bucketed / categorical PRODUCT events (e.g. ``core_started``,
``feature_used {feature: ...}``). Never task content, message text, prompts,
logs, file paths, or any PII. See ``TELEMETRY.md`` for the exact list.

How it is sent
--------------
A best-effort JSON POST to PostHog's ``/capture`` endpoint over the standard
library (no third-party dependency), fired in a daemon thread so it can never
block or crash the app. Any error is swallowed.

Opting out (checked live on every call — never cached)
------------------------------------------------------
Set ANY of the following and all telemetry becomes a silent no-op:

* ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1``     — the cross-project standard (Astro, Bun, Prisma, …)
* ``SUTANDO_TELEMETRY=0``
* a file named ``telemetry-disabled`` in EITHER the durable OS data dir (see
  Identity below — survives workspace churn / app updates) OR the legacy
  ``<workspace>/state/`` dir. A marker in either location opts you out.

Identity
--------
A random per-install UUID persisted at the durable, update-surviving OS data
dir (macOS: ``~/Library/Application Support/Sutando/telemetry-id``; other:
``${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/sutando/telemetry-id``), with a back-compat
copy at the legacy ``<workspace>/state/telemetry-id``. It
is not a device fingerprint and is not tied to any account or email. Events set
``$ip=""`` and ``$geoip_disable`` so PostHog does not store or geolocate the
request IP; the network-level source IP is inherent to any HTTPS request (as
with any website the machine contacts) and is not used for attribution.

Config
------
* ``POSTHOG_API_KEY`` — the PostHog *project* key. ``phc_...`` keys are public
  and write-only, so one may be embedded in ``_EMBEDDED_KEY`` below for
  distribution. Absent a key, telemetry is a no-op.
* ``POSTHOG_HOST``    — defaults to the US cloud (``https://us.i.posthog.com``).
* ``SUTANDO_DEBUG_TELEMETRY=1`` — print every event to stderr before sending.
