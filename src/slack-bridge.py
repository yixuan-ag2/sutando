"""
Slack bridge for Sutando — receives DMs + @mentions via Socket Mode, writes to
tasks/, sends replies from results/. Works alongside the voice / discord /
telegram bridges. Runs as a background daemon.

Usage: python3 src/slack-bridge.py

Env vars:
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN  — xoxb-... from app's OAuth & Permissions page
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN  — xapp-... from app's Basic Information page
                       (Socket Mode enabled, scope `connections:write`)

Bot scopes (OAuth & Permissions):
    chat:write, im:history, im:write, app_mentions:read,
    channels:history, groups:history, files:read, files:write,
    users:read

Access list (TOFU onboarding, same schema as telegram):
    $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/slack/access.json
        {"allowFrom": ["U0123..."], "tofuOwner": "U0123...", ...}

File round-trip:
    Inbound  — files attached to DMs/mentions are downloaded into
               $SUTANDO_WORKSPACE/slack-inbox/ and the path is surfaced
               in the task body as "[File attached: /path]".
    Outbound — result bodies may include [file: /path], [send: /path],
               or [attach: /path] markers. Paths are allowlisted via
               _is_path_sendable() (same realpath+startswith sanitizer
               the telegram/discord bridges use) and uploaded via
               files_upload_v2.
