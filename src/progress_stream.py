"""Progress-streaming helpers for the messaging bridges (issue: Hermes-style
streaming tool output, 2026-06-05).

Pure, side-effect-free helpers so the policy + rendering are unit-testable in
isolation from the async Discord/Telegram bridge that drives them. The bridge
owns message I/O (post + edit); this module only decides *whether* and *what*
to show.

The streamed signal source is the core's ``state/core-status.json`` (the same
file the web dashboard reads) — see CLAUDE.md "Work Status". It is a single,
global status for the one running core, so for the common single-task case the
``step`` reflects the task the user is waiting on. Concurrent tasks share the
status; the placeholder then shows whatever the core is currently doing, which
is acceptable for a progress hint (documented, not a correctness claim).

Python 3.9 compatible (workspace runs system python3 = 3.9.6): future
annotations, no PEP-604 runtime unions, no ``datetime.UTC``.
