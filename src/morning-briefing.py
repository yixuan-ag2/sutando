    predicate, and the two copies drifted: on 2026-07-28 the notifier counted 33
    and this counted 32. The missing entry was a live owner ask
    ("/observe MVP: design fully resolved, build on your nod") dropped because
    the local copy tested `'RESOLVED' in title.upper()` — a substring match that
    fires on the word appearing anywhere in the prose, including in "NOT

    #2351 had already fixed the notifier's side (`Status: open`) without this one
    changing. So the predicate now lives in exactly one place.

    That invariant was initially only half-true: this function still dropped
    organizer shells and inline `[RESOLVED ...]` titles locally, so the two
    consumers reported different counts (notifier 2 / briefing 1 on a corpus with
    one active marker plus one open ask) — review finding on 919c35f2. Both
    classifications now live in the shared parser, and nothing here judges
    waiting-ness; this function only maps the result to display titles.

    Deliberately no fallback parser: a second implementation is the bug. And a
    failure here must not degrade to `[]`, which the briefing would render as the
    confident "no pending questions" that this whole class of bug produces.

    not observe and cannot verify, so a run that reached nobody looked identical
    to one that reached the owner. Observed 2026-07-21: six proactive results,
    the oldest 8h old, sat undrained while every run printed "delivered".

    Extracted so the claim is testable rather than an inline literal (same shape
    as `summary_line` in health-check.py).
