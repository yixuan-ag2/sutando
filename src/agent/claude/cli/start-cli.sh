# src/agent/claude/cli/start-cli.sh — canonical launch script for the sutando-core
# tmux session. Single source of truth for the "how to start Claude Code" command,
# so startup.sh + Sutando.app's Restart Core menu can both invoke it without
# duplicating the launch arguments.
#
# Usage:
#   bash src/agent/claude/cli/start-cli.sh           # start (or attach if running)
#   bash src/agent/claude/cli/start-cli.sh --restart # kill existing session then start fresh
#
# Per Chi's prompt 2026-05-05 ("shall we add core CLI-related commands in
# sutando app"): extracting the launch command from startup.sh's inline tmux
# block lets the menu-bar app's Restart Core action invoke the same canonical
# entry without re-implementing the tmux flags.

#   - Unset (upstream default): no override — the core launches from $REPO (the

#   - Set (e.g. Sutando.app exports SUTANDO_CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR=$HOME/.sutando/repo):
#     anchor the core's CWD there instead. Claude Code slugs its project /
#     auto-memory dir off the cwd, so a stable cwd (not $REPO, which moves across
#     upgrades / app bundles) keeps that project + memory continuous.
#     SCOPE: this sets ONLY the cwd. It does NOT relocate CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
#     (sessions / memory / config) — that is resolved independently from
#     sutando.config's `workspace.path` (read via scripts/sutando-config.sh,
#     below). If $REPO is a moving bundle path, set `workspace.path` to a stable
#     location too; this env var alone won't move CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR off $REPO.
# Applied uniformly via a tmux `-c` arg array (and a plain `cd` on the no-tmux
# fallback) so every launch branch agrees. The ${arr[@]+...} expansions below
# keep the empty (unset) case safe on bash 3.2 under `set -u`, same pattern as
# MODEL_ARGS / SETTINGS_ARGS.
#
# CANONICALIZE ONCE, REUSE EVERYWHERE: Claude Code keys the folder-trust dialog
# (and the project/auto-memory slug) by the process's ABSOLUTE cwd — getcwd(),
# with symlinks resolved. So resolve the override to its physical absolute path
# here and re-export it; the SAME value then feeds mkdir, tmux `-c` / the no-tmux
# `cd`, AND the trust-dialog seed in the onboarding block below. A raw value with
# a leading ~, a relative segment, or a symlinked parent would otherwise seed
# projects[<wrong key>] in .claude.json, and the detached no-TTY core would still
# hang at the trust prompt. Expand a leading ~, create the dir (fail loud with a
# scoped message if we can't — better than chdir'ing into the wrong place under
# set -e's raw error), then resolve via `cd … && pwd -P`.

# HAZARD: --restart MUST NOT be invoked from inside the sutando-core

# Safe callers: Sutando.app menu, terminal one-off, future health-check
# emit-task. Unsafe: a future agent processing a "restart core" task by
# exec'ing this script from within sutando-core. Per Mini's #608 review.
# Two modes, per sonichi's "force restart should be separate from restart":
#   --restart       graceful: SIGTERM + wait; if the core won't stop cleanly it
#                   ABORTS (it may be mid-task) — never SIGKILLs on its own.
#   --force-restart SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation for a wedged/unresponsive core.
# Both then fall through to the create path, which verifies the new core is live
# before exit 0 (no silent false-success). Every attempt is logged (timestamped)
