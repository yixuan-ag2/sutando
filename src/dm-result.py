"""Send a task result to Discord DM if voice client is disconnected.

Usage:
    python3 src/dm-result.py "Result text here"
    python3 src/dm-result.py --file results/task-123.txt

Checks http://localhost:8080/sse-status for voiceConnected.
If voice is connected, does nothing (voice agent will speak the result).
If voice is disconnected, sends the result to the owner's Discord DM.

Requires DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN in .env (or in $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/discord/.env)
and the Discord bridge running.

Owner resolution:
    1. $SUTANDO_DM_OWNER_ID env var (explicit override).
    2. First non-bot user in $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/discord/access.json → allowFrom.
The bot's own user ID is discovered via Discord's GET /users/@me so that
multi-owner allowFrom lists still resolve to the human.

Per-node correctness:
    The DM channel ID is NOT hardcoded — each node creates/opens its own
    DM channel on demand via POST /users/@me/channels (idempotent per
    Discord docs). This fixes the HTTP 403 seen on Mac Mini when the old
    hardcoded channel ID belonged to MacBook's bot's DM with the owner.
