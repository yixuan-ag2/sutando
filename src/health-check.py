Sutando health check — verifies all components are running correctly.

Usage:
  python3 src/health-check.py                  # full check, human-readable
  python3 src/health-check.py --json           # machine-readable output
  python3 src/health-check.py --fix            # attempt to fix issues
  python3 src/health-check.py --emit-task      # write tasks/task-health-*.txt on failure
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-on-fail # macOS notification on failure
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-slack   # DM the owner on Slack on failure (remote, core-independent)
  python3 src/health-check.py --recover-core   # auto-restart the core when alive-but-wedged (guarded)

Checks:
  - macOS TCC Documents-folder access (when repo is under ~/Documents)
  - Voice agent (port 9900), web client, agent API, dashboard
  - Critical files (CLAUDE.md, build_log.md, ACTIVITY.md)
  - Memory system (MEMORY.md index, key memory files)
  - Notes directory

    quota-state.json is written by the proxy from the quota headers on

    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7846 — and a core launched by the

    proxy is healthy and listening, every check is green, and quota

    The existing credential-proxy check can't catch this: it is a plain

    wire-format fixes applied. Greps the Gemini sendAudio/sendFile bodies
    for the post-fix `audio:`/`video:` keys rather than the deprecated
    `media:` key.

    Added 2026-04-09 after the 1007 "media_chunks is deprecated" regression:
    package-lock.json pointed at the post-fix bodhi commit, but the dist
    on disk was stale (git pull advanced the lockfile without triggering
    npm install). voice-agent booted fine because sendAudio isn't
    exercised until a client connects — so existing probes silently let
    it through. This probe catches that case on every health tick.

    Fix when this check fails: `npm install github:sonichi/bodhi_realtime_agent`
    then `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sutando.voice-agent`.

    Scans whichever artifact the voice-agent ACTUALLY loads, because that
    differs by deployment and the node_modules copy is not always the one
    running:

      - dev checkout  -> node_modules/bodhi-realtime-agent/dist/index.js
      - bundled app   -> dist/voice-agent.js, an esbuild bundle with bodhi
                         inlined and NO node_modules on disk at all

    Checking only the node_modules path made this probe useless in exactly
    the deployment where it matters: a bundled install has an empty
    node_modules, so the check warned "run `npm install`" on every tick
    (noise that reads as benign) while giving ZERO coverage of the running
    bundle. The 1007 regression this was written to catch would have
    shipped undetected. The body scan below needs no change — it matches

# Core wedge auto-recovery (--recover-core)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 2026-06-02 outage: the core session crossed into 1M extended context,
# hit the interactive `/usage-credits` gate — which CANNOT be pre-authorized
# for an unattended agent (it's a per-session, account-side toggle, no
# settings key / env var / CLI flag exists) — and then looped on the API
# error. core_heartbeat.py runs as its own process, so the core still "looked
# alive" while no task ever drained. --notify-slack makes that VISIBLE; this
# makes it SELF-HEALING.
#
# Recovery action is the one mechanism we already own and trust:
# `src/agent/start-cli.sh --restart`. The dispatcher restarts whichever core
# runtime is configured. A restarted session starts fresh under the
# standard context boundary; because the /usage-credits enable persists
# ACCOUNT-WIDE once a human sets it (and on Max/Team plans 1M is included with
# no gate at all), the restarted core keeps 1M and re-clears the gate by
# itself. Queued task files survive a restart (the bridge is file-based), so
# no work is lost. 1M therefore stays the DEFAULT — we never disable it.
#
# Heavily guarded, because auto-restarting a 24/7 agent is consequential:
#   - Fires only on a CONFIRMED, SUSTAINED wedge: core process alive AND the
#     oldest queued task older than RECOVER_WEDGE_SEC AND the core didn't just
#     boot — observed on two passes ≥ RECOVER_CONFIRM_SEC apart. Never a blip.
#   - Identity + progress gating (so a legitimately long-running single task is
#     not killed mid-work): the SAME oldest task must persist across the window
#     (a draining queue surfaces a different oldest each pass → resets) AND
#     core-status.json must not advance (a core making progress isn't wedged).
#     Residual: a long single task that NEVER updates its status is still
#     indistinguishable from a wedge by external signals — bounded by the
#     cooldown + give-up cap, and such tasks should heartbeat core-status.json.
#   - RECOVER_COOLDOWN_SEC between restarts; an exclusive flock on the state
#     file serializes the decision so a manual + launchd run can't double-fire.
#   - Hard cap of RECOVER_MAX_PER_HOUR; past that it DMs "giving up" and stops,
#     so a pathological wedge can't become a restart loop.
#   - Graceful degradation: the FIRST restart of an episode keeps 1M; if the
#     wedge recurs (the 1M restart didn't hold), the next restart pins
#     SUTANDO_CORE_MODEL=opus (standard 200K) so the agent keeps WORKING.
#   - DMs the owner before each restart and records whether the DM succeeded
#     (last_restart_dm_sent) + logs failures, so a restart is never invisible
#     even if Slack is down — recovery still proceeds (recovery > notification).
#
# All side-effecting collaborators are injectable so the escalation / cooldown
# / give-up logic is unit-tested without real restarts or Slack calls. Only
# wired into the launchd fallback job (its own process, outside the core), and
# start-cli.sh has its own from-inside-core guard — two independent guarantees
# the recovery never runs from within the session it would kill.

# recover_core_if_wedged handles a core that is alive-but-STUCK; the dead-core
# relaunch (PR #2160) handles a core that EXITED. Neither catches the failure
# mode observed 2026-07-17: the core session alive and responsive, but its
# IN-SESSION cron layer dead — session crons are registered per-session via
# CronCreate and auto-expire after 7 days, so a long-lived core (23 days that
# morning) silently outlives its own crons. Scheduled work (the morning report,
# the briefing, the */5 main loop) stops firing while every liveness probe
# reads healthy. Owner: "Core was not dead. Cron was dead."
#
# Heartbeat source: `<workspace>/state/core-status.json` `ts`. The canonical
# main-loop cron (/proactive-loop) stamps it at every pass start AND end
# (CLAUDE.md "Work Status" / proactive-loop step 0), so a live cron layer
# advances `ts` at least once per main-loop period — no new writer needed. A
# frozen `ts` while the core heartbeat (`state/cores/<host>.alive` mtime) stays
# fresh means the scheduler died inside the session. Other activity (task
# processing) also stamps `ts`; that can only DELAY detection, never
# false-fire it.
#
# CRON_STALE_SEC = 1800: 3 × the 10-minute /schedule-crons step-4 fallback
# cadence — the LARGEST canonical main-loop period. Tolerates one long pass
# plus one missed tick before declaring the layer dead; a */5 config simply
# detects a little later than it strictly could.
#
# Recovery is a NUDGE, not a restart: type `/schedule-crons` into the live
# core's tmux pane — the same keystroke channel Sutando.app's checkWatcher
# uses (`watcher` keystroke) when the task watcher dies — so the session
# re-arms its own crons and keeps its context. Bounded by the SAME
# confirm/cooldown/give-up discipline as the wedge path so it can't
# nudge-storm a pane.
