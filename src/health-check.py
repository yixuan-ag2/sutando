Sutando health check — verifies all components are running correctly.

Usage:
  python3 src/health-check.py                  # full check, human-readable
  python3 src/health-check.py --json           # machine-readable output
  python3 src/health-check.py --fix            # attempt to fix issues
  python3 src/health-check.py --emit-task      # write tasks/task-health-*.txt on failure
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-on-fail # macOS notification on failure
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-slack   # DM the owner on Slack on failure (remote, core-independent)
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-gateway # DM the owner on ag2.space/gateway on failure (remote, core-independent)
  python3 src/health-check.py --recover-core   # auto-restart the core when alive-but-wedged (guarded)

Checks:
  - macOS TCC Documents-folder access (when repo is under ~/Documents)
  - Voice agent (port 9900), web client, agent API, dashboard

# between 25_000 and 25_600 reports healthy while its tail is already dropped.

    A DIRECTORY and the files inside it are different questions for git, and the

    directories while every file beneath stays ignored — `!hosts/**` is what
    carries the contents. So `check-ignore` on `hosts/a` answered "not ignored"
    while `hosts/a/current-track.md` was ignored and unbacked, and the probe
    reported the vault healthy with the very file it exists to protect not being
    backed up. Reproduced independently by john-the-dev and qingyun-wu on
    a958d06f, and confirmed here before changing anything.

    So a directory is probed through EVERY file beneath it, and any ignored one
    condemns the entry. Exhaustive rather than sampled: a 26-file directory whose
    26th file alone was ignored read `ok` under the old 25-file cap
    (john-the-dev, #2572), which is the exact silent non-backup this exists for.

    `--no-index` stays load-bearing and the instrument stays `check-ignore` for
    a reason worth recording: the obvious alternative,
    `ls-files --others --ignored`, is index-AWARE, so it calls a tracked file
    carried. That silently reverses a documented behavior —
    `test_a_TRACKED_file_with_a_stale_exclude_is_still_reported` exists because a
    host that carried a file once and then let its exclude go stale read healthy
    forever while nothing NEW under that entry was being carried. I wrote the
    ls-files version first and that test failed; it was right and I was wrong.

    Used by BOTH the stale and dropped branches. The stale branch probes a
    directory representative too and had the same blindness; fixing only the

      1. STALE EXCLUDE — the resolved config lists an entry that git still

      2. DROPPED BY OVERRIDE — a local `vault.sync.include` REPLACES the shipped

         later never reach this host. Remedy: add them to the local list. Here
         the on-disk exclude legitimately MATCHES the resolved config, so cause 1
         is dormant and a resolved-vs-disk comparison alone reads healthy.

    Asking git directly (`check-ignore`) rather than regenerating the exclude and
    diffing is deliberate: it tests the OUTCOME, cannot drift as the generator's
    formatting changes, and is immune to the two legitimate no-diff branches
    (`:562` no-op when already matching, `:570` safe legacy `hosts/<label>/` ->

    # 262 — a strict superset, nothing missing. Chi corrected the claim; Sutando-Pro
    # independently confirmed it from `state/current-track.md`'s own two-commit history.

    was warning, because "approaching" says nothing about whether that is a week
    away or an hour. The history says which:

        08-03 14:04   24,988 B   headroom     12 B   <- survived by 12 bytes

    account for the curve. A warning that cannot say "it nearly truncated today"
    is a warning that invites exactly the shrug it got.

    A memory only loads if it is (a) present in the LIVE memory dir and (b)

    us (recurring field report 64340119): a memory file written to the live dir
    but never added to MEMORY.md, and a hard-won capability memory stranded in a
    ``*-BACKUP`` tree (created by scripts/sutando-migrate.sh) that never made it
    into the live index — so the rule it carried was written yet never recalled.

    A third mode has the same consequence: the entry EXISTS but sits past the
    point a session stops reading (200 lines or 25KB of post-strip content,
    whichever comes first — see MEMORY_INDEX_LOAD_*). Truncation drops the
    suffix, not the file, so this is measured by asking whether each memory is
    named in the prefix that actually loads.

    Not every absence from MEMORY.md is a loss, though: overflow entries live in
    sibling HUB indexes (``MEMORY-reference.md``, ``MEMORY-wire.md``, …) which
    MEMORY.md links to. Those are grep-reachable by design and are counted

    discarded because the skew tolerance below is only safe when the launch record
    and the marker positively agree on the runtime; see

    Both launchers append one line per launch — `src/agent/claude/cli/start-cli.sh:610`
    and `src/agent/codex/cli/start-cli.sh:243` — and both stamp the `host` that launched.

    Only THIS host's records are eligible. `session-starts.log` lives in a workspace that
    is synced across hosts, so the newest line globally is not this host's boundary: a
    later launch on host B would otherwise become host A's boundary and age host A's
    perfectly current marker into a false `warn` — the exact false-positive class this
    check exists to suppress (qingyun-wu + john-the-dev, #2446, independently reproduced:

    Legacy policy, stated explicitly: a record whose `host` is absent, non-string, or
    belongs to another host is SKIPPED, never treated as local. Pre-`host` lines cannot
    be attributed, and guessing "probably local" reintroduces the same poisoning from
    older synced logs. Skipping them can leave no boundary at all, which yields None —
    and None already means "no evidence", never "stale", so the failure direction is
    silence rather than a false alarm.

    The heartbeat was the obvious candidate and is WRONG: `core_heartbeat.py` stamps
    `_STARTED_AT` once at module load and both launch paths RETAIN an existing heartbeat
    process, so `.alive.started_at` is the heartbeat process's age, not the session's.
    After a Codex → Claude switch it can be far older than a freshly-written marker,
    which made the staleness comparison silently useless (john-the-dev, #2446).

    ``True``  -> the core is routed through the credential proxy.

                 manufactured from it would be the same defect this check is fixing,
                 pointed the other way.

    Why this exists: ``quota-state.json`` is written by the credential proxy, not by
    the core, so a FRESH file only proves *something* routed through the proxy — not
    that the core did. Measured on 2026-08-02: one throwaway ``claude -p`` run with
    the variable set refreshed the file and flipped this check from a truthful
    ``warn`` (18h stale) to ``ok`` for the whole 6h staleness window, while the
    production core was exactly as unrouted as before. Freshness is a property of the
    artifact; routing is a property of the process.

    The pid comes from tmux rather than ``pgrep``: ``pgrep -f claude`` matches any argv
    containing the string — including the shell running this check — and macOS
    ``pgrep -a`` lists ancestors, not argv.

    But a pane pid is only useful if it is the CORE's pane. The first version of this
    helper targeted the session (``list-panes -t =sutando-core``), which tmux resolves
    to that session's **current window** — and this repo deliberately keeps sibling
    windows (gateway, monitor) in the same session, healing window-scoped precisely so
    they survive (`src/agent/claude/cli/start-cli.sh`). A reviewer built the case and it
    reproduced: with the ``gateway`` window active, the production command returned the
    gateway's pid, so the helper would report on a sibling's environment — false green or
    false warning, independent of the real core. Window NAME is no discriminator either;
    on this host the core's window is auto-named ``2.1.220`` after the claude version.

    So enumerate EVERY pane in the session (``list-panes -s``) and identify the core by
    what it actually is: the process whose argv carries ``--name <session>``, which is
    exactly how `start-cli.sh` launches it. Zero matches or more than one -> ``None``;
    an ambiguous session is not evidence of a bypass.

    Both subprocess calls are injectable so the contract is testable without a live
    core; production passes neither.

                                 healthy idle hosts is how a check gets muted.

    ...but PRESENCE ALONE IS SATISFIED BY A HISTORICAL WRITE. This check exists
    to catch "the proxy is up and nothing routes through it", and it detects
    only the *never-wired* case. A host that WAS wired, wrote quota-state.json
    once, and then lost the wiring keeps a file on disk forever and reads green
    forever — the exact condition this check was written to make loud, in the
    one shape it cannot see. Observed on this fleet: quota-state.json 323h old,
    credential-proxy `ok`, quota-telemetry `ok`, and the proactive loop's
    per-pass budget gate quoting 13-day-old percentages as current.

    Staleness only becomes evidence when the "quiet core" explanation is ruled
    OUT, so the stale branch is gated on the agent being demonstrably at work:
    core-status.json is rewritten by the agent on every loop pass, and each of
    those writes belongs to a turn that spent tokens. Fresh core-status plus
    stale quota-state means requests are flowing while quota headers are not
    landing — wiring, not quiet. An idle host has a stale core-status too, so
    it stays silent, and a host that never wired at all still takes the
    absent-file branch below.

    Why this exists (owner-reported 2026-08-01): the core was on a model, ran
    OVER QUOTA, and then every task stalled with no report — the agent went dark
    with no signal to the owner. `check_quota_telemetry` above only warns on the
    ABSENCE of quota-state.json; it deliberately never reads the values, so an
    *exhausted* quota reads as "ok, quota state present" and the outage stays
    invisible. This check closes that gap by reading the state and failing on an
    EXPLICIT exhaustion signal (unified status "rejected" or available:false),
    while leaving unknown/missing/corrupt state non-paging (fail-safe).

    Delivery is automatic and core-independent: a `fail` here is picked up by
    `_slack_failures()` → `notify_slack_for_failures()`, the remote owner DM that
    runs from the launchd health-check-fallback and does NOT depend on the (now
    stuck) core agent being able to speak. Dedup is the shared transition-hash
    contract, so the owner is told once per episode, not every tick.

    Staleness guard (fail-safe): quota-state.json is written by the credential
    proxy from upstream rate-limit headers. An *actively* over-quota core keeps
    hitting the API (429s carry the headers), so a genuine exhaustion reads
    FRESH + not-available. A stale not-available reading is ambiguous (an old
    snapshot from a long-quiet host), so we DON'T raise an owner alert on it —

    for the post-fix `audio:`/`video:` keys rather than the deprecated
    `media:` key.

    Added 2026-04-09 after the 1007 "media_chunks is deprecated" regression:
    package-lock.json pointed at the post-fix bodhi commit, but the dist
    on disk was stale (git pull advanced the lockfile without triggering
    npm install). voice-agent booted fine because sendAudio isn't
    exercised until a client connects — so existing probes silently let
    it through. This probe catches that case on every health tick.

    Fix when this check fails: `npm install github:sonichi/bodhi_realtime_agent`
    then `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sutando.voice-agent`.

    Scans whichever artifact the voice-agent ACTUALLY loads, because that
    differs by deployment and the node_modules copy is not always the one
    running:

      - dev checkout  -> node_modules/bodhi-realtime-agent/dist/index.js
      - bundled app   -> dist/voice-agent.js, an esbuild bundle with bodhi
                         inlined and NO node_modules on disk at all

    Checking only the node_modules path made this probe useless in exactly
    the deployment where it matters: a bundled install has an empty
    node_modules, so the check warned "run `npm install`" on every tick
    (noise that reads as benign) while giving ZERO coverage of the running
    bundle. The 1007 regression this was written to catch would have
    shipped undetected. The body scan below needs no change — it matches
    the bundled output as-is.

    is a message that exists on disk and reaches no one — the same failure as

    Discord will never accept (a 413 never becomes a 200). The action is for a

    The vault splits its state in two: names live in the manifest
    (`<workspace>/state/secret-vault/keys.json`), values live in macOS Keychain.
    Nothing keeps the halves in step. A name can outlive its secret — a Keychain
    entry deleted by hand, a machine restored from backup, or a manifest carried
    forward by the legacy-path self-migration in `vault_intercept._read_manifest`.

    The divergence is silent in the direction that matters. CLAUDE.md tells every
    integration to discover keys via `list_vault_keys()` and then fetch with
    `get_vault_key()`. A phantom name passes discovery and raises KeyError on
    fetch, so the documented pattern points callers AT keys that cannot resolve —
    strictly worse than the key simply being absent, because the list says it is
    there. Observed on this host 2026-08-04: 15 advertised, 2 backed, 13 phantom.

    POSITIVE CONTROL, deliberately (`security find-generic-password` exits 44 both
    for "no such key" AND for a wrong `-a <account>`, measured). So a bad account
    name, a locked keychain, or a missing binary would otherwise report EVERY key
    phantom — a maximally alarming, entirely wrong answer. This probe therefore
    refuses to report divergence unless at least one name resolves: zero-of-N is
    treated as "the checker is broken", not "the vault is empty". The cost is
    real (a genuinely 100%-phantom manifest reads inconclusive), and that is the
    correct direction to fail — a false clean here is a nag nobody can act on,
    while a false alarm would send the operator hunting a vault that is fine.

    RESOLUTION MUST MIRROR `_read_manifest()`, canonical-first THEN legacy. The
    first version read only `_manifest_path()` and returned "no vault manifest on
    this host" when the canonical file was absent — while `list_vault_keys()`,
    reading through `_read_manifest()`, still returned the legacy manifest's keys.
    That is a false clean on a pre-migration install, i.e. on exactly the
    population this check exists to diagnose. A probe that does not walk the same
    lookup path as the function it validates is checking a different system.

    single-owner lane (the driver lives in sonichi/sutando-personal and runs on

    """Liveness for `loop: "dynamic"` entries — the one scheduled thing nothing else sees.

    A dynamic loop self-paces through ScheduleWakeup, so it is NOT a cron job
    (absent from CronList, so the `session-crons` probe can't count it) and NOT
    an OS process (invisible to pgrep, so no PID sentinel applies). Every other
    liveness probe here keys off one of those two. A dynamic loop that stops
    re-arming therefore pages nobody — which is not hypothetical: the
    inbox-score loop died 2026-07-21 and owner-comm sweeps lapsed for days
    before anyone noticed. `check_comm_sweep_freshness` above makes the
    downstream symptom loud; this closes the same gap one layer up, at the loop.

    The sentinel carries its OWN threshold. `/loop`'s body stamps
    `state/dynamic-loop-<name>.alive` with `{ts, next_delay_s}` on every re-arm,
    so the probe compares against the cadence the loop just chose rather than a
    hardcoded one a self-pacing loop is free to change: warn past
    `next_delay_s + 120`, down past `2*next_delay_s + 300`.

    Age comes from the payload's `ts`, not mtime. `state/cores/*.alive` is
    deliberately vault-EXCLUDED so a synced mtime can never fake liveness;
    `state/dynamic-loop-*.alive` is NOT excluded, so its mtime can be rewritten
    by a sync on an unrelated host. The self-reported `ts` is the honest clock;
    mtime is a fallback for a payload that won't parse, and the detail says so.

    Returns a LIST — one row per loop this host declares OR has a sentinel for,
    and an EMPTY list on a host with neither. That is the lane-awareness lesson
    from `check_comm_sweep_freshness`: a permanent warn on a host with nothing
    to monitor is how a health output gets ignored, which would take this
    probe's real alarms down with it.

    Enumeration is the UNION of the two sources, and that is load-bearing.
    Config gates the ABSENT branch only: `crons.json` can add a loop to watch
    (declared-but-never-stamped ⇒ warn), but it can never remove one, because a
    sentinel on disk is judged on its age no matter what the config says. An
    earlier revision enumerated from `crons.json` alone, so deleting the entry
    during an unrelated edit dropped a genuinely stalled loop out of
    `run_all_checks()` entirely — a probe whose whole purpose is "a stall that
    pages nobody" going silent in exactly that direction.

    `--notify-slack` each consume the FULL `checks` list through their own

    a one-check witness: notification written, 1 Slack message, 1 task file).

    benign. A probe sets `"alerting": False` when its result is genuinely
    informational — visible on the dashboard, never a page.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Core wedge auto-recovery (--recover-core)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 2026-06-02 outage: the core session crossed into 1M extended context,
# hit the interactive `/usage-credits` gate — which CANNOT be pre-authorized
# for an unattended agent (it's a per-session, account-side toggle, no
# settings key / env var / CLI flag exists) — and then looped on the API
# error. core_heartbeat.py runs as its own process, so the core still "looked
# alive" while no task ever drained. --notify-slack makes that VISIBLE; this
# makes it SELF-HEALING.
#
# Recovery action is the one mechanism we already own and trust:
# `src/agent/start-cli.sh --restart`. The dispatcher restarts whichever core
# runtime is configured. A restarted session starts fresh under the
# standard context boundary; because the /usage-credits enable persists
# ACCOUNT-WIDE once a human sets it (and on Max/Team plans 1M is included with
# no gate at all), the restarted core keeps 1M and re-clears the gate by
# itself. Queued task files survive a restart (the bridge is file-based), so
# no work is lost. 1M therefore stays the DEFAULT — we never disable it.
#
# Heavily guarded, because auto-restarting a 24/7 agent is consequential:
#   - Fires only on a CONFIRMED, SUSTAINED wedge: core process alive AND the
#     oldest queued task older than RECOVER_WEDGE_SEC AND the core didn't just
#     boot — observed on two passes ≥ RECOVER_CONFIRM_SEC apart. Never a blip.
#   - Identity + progress gating (so a legitimately long-running single task is
#     not killed mid-work): the SAME oldest task must persist across the window
#     (a draining queue surfaces a different oldest each pass → resets) AND
#     core-status.json must not advance (a core making progress isn't wedged).
#     Residual: a long single task that NEVER updates its status is still
#     indistinguishable from a wedge by external signals — bounded by the
#     cooldown + give-up cap, and such tasks should heartbeat core-status.json.
#   - RECOVER_COOLDOWN_SEC between restarts; an exclusive flock on the state
#     file serializes the decision so a manual + launchd run can't double-fire.
#   - Hard cap of RECOVER_MAX_PER_HOUR; past that it DMs "giving up" and stops,
#     so a pathological wedge can't become a restart loop.
#   - Graceful degradation: the FIRST restart of an episode keeps 1M; if the
#     wedge recurs (the 1M restart didn't hold), the next restart pins
#     SUTANDO_CORE_MODEL=opus (standard 200K) so the agent keeps WORKING.
#   - DMs the owner before each restart and records whether the DM succeeded
#     (last_restart_dm_sent) + logs failures, so a restart is never invisible
#     even if Slack is down — recovery still proceeds (recovery > notification).
#
# All side-effecting collaborators are injectable so the escalation / cooldown
# / give-up logic is unit-tested without real restarts or Slack calls. Only
# wired into the launchd fallback job (its own process, outside the core), and
# start-cli.sh has its own from-inside-core guard — two independent guarantees
# the recovery never runs from within the session it would kill.

# Cron-layer death in a LIVE core (the third recovery gap)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# recover_core_if_wedged handles a core that is alive-but-STUCK; the dead-core
# relaunch (PR #2160) handles a core that EXITED. Neither catches the failure
# mode observed 2026-07-17: the core session alive and responsive, but its
# IN-SESSION cron layer dead — session crons are registered per-session via
# CronCreate and auto-expire after 7 days, so a long-lived core (23 days that
# morning) silently outlives its own crons. Scheduled work (the morning report,
# the briefing, the */5 main loop) stops firing while every liveness probe
# reads healthy. Owner: "Core was not dead. Cron was dead."
#
# Heartbeat source: `<workspace>/state/core-status.json` `ts`. The canonical
# main-loop cron (/proactive-loop) stamps it at every pass start AND end
# (CLAUDE.md "Work Status" / proactive-loop step 0), so a live cron layer
# advances `ts` at least once per main-loop period — no new writer needed. A
# frozen `ts` while the core heartbeat (`state/cores/<host>.alive` mtime) stays
# fresh means the scheduler died inside the session. Other activity (task
# processing) also stamps `ts`; that can only DELAY detection, never
# false-fire it.
#
# CRON_STALE_SEC = 1800: 3 × the 10-minute /schedule-crons step-4 fallback
# cadence — the LARGEST canonical main-loop period. Tolerates one long pass
# plus one missed tick before declaring the layer dead; a */5 config simply
# detects a little later than it strictly could.
#
# Recovery is a NUDGE, not a restart: type `/schedule-crons` into the live
# core's tmux pane — the same keystroke channel Sutando.app's checkWatcher
# uses (`watcher` keystroke) when the task watcher dies — so the session
# re-arms its own crons and keeps its context. Bounded by the SAME
# confirm/cooldown/give-up discipline as the wedge path so it can't

    severe status any probe emits, and the one nine probes use — on the least
    alarming glyph, sharing it with "status I don't recognize". `error` (5 probes)
    and `wedged` landed there too.

    It is a real miss, not a cosmetic one: a peer host filtered health-check output
    with `grep -E "⚠|✗"` and the single `fail` line was the one the filter hid, so a
    run with a genuine failure read as three routine warnings.

    `--quiet` never had this bug — it renders every non-stale issue as `✗`. The two
    output modes disagreed about the same status. This makes them agree by deriving
    both from one predicate, and inverts the default so a status added later shows
    up as a problem until someone deliberately classifies it as benign.
