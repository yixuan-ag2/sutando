"""runtime-health.py — derive this Sutando core's live health as one JSON object.

The machine-readable "is my agent working, idle, stuck-at-login, or offline?"
signal. The desktop app's Console renders it as a plain-English status strip +
one-click action cards (regular users) instead of making them read a raw
terminal; `sutando-whoami` can embed it too. Owner-designed 2026-07-13 — the
"when she's not responding, I can't tell if she's thinking or stuck" painpoint,
made concrete when a core sat unresponsive at claude's `/login` (locked keychain).

    python3 src/runtime-health.py           # prints JSON; also writes state/runtime-health.json

Output (single JSON object on stdout):
    health           working | idle | needs_login | offline | unknown
    authenticated    bool | null  (false when the core is sitting at claude's login prompt;
                     null when we can't tell, e.g. the core is offline)
    core_running     bool   (a `sutando-core` tmux session exists on the socket)
    gateway_running  bool   (the relay gateway bridge process is up)
    tmux_socket      the SUTANDO_TMUX_SOCKET this probed (private-socket aware)
    session          the tmux session name
    detail           short human string for the status strip

Design: every probe is best-effort and degrades — a missing tmux or an
unreadable status file yields `unknown`, never a crash. This is a read-only
observer; it starts nothing and kills nothing.
