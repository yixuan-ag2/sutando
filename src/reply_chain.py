"""Reply-context formatting (pure) — companion to ``discord-bridge.py``.

When the owner replies to a message, the bridge inlines the referenced message
into the task file so the core agent sees WHAT is being replied to without
having to re-fetch. This module owns the *formatting* of that block so the
truth table is unit-tested directly (same shape as ``discord_addressee.py`` /
``result_markers.py``); the bridge does the async Discord fetches and hands the
resolved primitives in here.

Why this exists (Chi 2026-07-25): the old bridge truncated the referenced
message to a 400-char snippet (``ref_content[:400]``), which silently dropped
context — including, in a deep thread, the root question ("you lost the original
question").

Lean design (Chi 2026-07-25, after weighing the alternative): inline the **full
immediate parent** (no truncation, size-clipped only for a pathological
multi-KB body), and emit the walked ancestor **ids** separately
(``reply_chain_ids``) so any deeper ancestor can be fetched precisely on demand.
We do NOT inline the whole chain's content: injecting the entire thread into
every reply's task file bloats it and can *bury* the actual message under a wall
of mostly-irrelevant quoted ancestors — a different failure than the one being
fixed. The full immediate parent is the direct referent (the 95% case); the id
spine is the reconstruction handle for the rest.

    this walk sat behind ``# pragma: no cover`` — meaning the depth cap and the
    unfetchable-ancestor path, the exact cases where context is silently lost,
    were the only ones never exercised. Assertions could not fix that; the walk
    had to become callable.

    ``fetch_message`` is an async ``id -> message | None`` (the bridge passes
    ``channel.fetch_message``); raising is treated the same as returning None,
