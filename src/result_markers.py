"""
Unified parsing for the result-body protocol markers used by every bridge
(discord, slack, telegram, voice/task-bridge). Closes #873.

Why centralize: each bridge previously hand-rolled its own marker recognition,
which (a) drifted (telegram never recognized [deduped:], slack never recognized
[channel:]), and (b) leaked literal marker text to the user when the bridge
didn't honor it. This module is the single source of truth for marker
shapes; bridges call `parse_markers(text)` and apply the actions they CAN
support, silently stripping the rest from the body so nothing ever leaks.

This module deliberately does NOT enforce path allowlists. File-marker
extraction returns paths; the bridge's own `_is_path_sendable()` check
must run at the upload sink. The reason: CodeQL's py/path-injection rule
recognizes `os.path.realpath(p)` + `p.startswith(allowed)` inline at the
sink. If we abstracted the allowlist behind a helper return value, CodeQL
would stop recognizing the sanitizer and start flagging every upload site.

Marker spec (matches CLAUDE.md → "Result-body protocol markers"):

  SKIP markers — at body start (must be the first non-whitespace chars):
    [no-send]
    [REPLIED]
    [deduped: <task-id>]
  When any of these is found, the bridge archives the task silently and
  delivers nothing to the user.

  REDIRECT marker — first non-empty line:
    [channel: <channel-id>]
  When found, the bridge delivers the body to <channel-id> instead of the
  task's originating channel. The body is the text AFTER this line.

  DM-ONLY marker — anywhere in the body:
    [dm-only]
  Privacy guard: suppresses any [channel:] redirect on the same body (no
  redirect action is emitted), so a body carrying private data can never be
  redirected out to a shared channel. It emits a dm-only action but does NOT
  by itself route to the owner's DM — that stays the consumer's job. In
  practice the private producer (the morning briefing's calendar + email) is
  emitted as a proactive result (results/proactive-*.txt), which every bridge
  already delivers to the owner's DM; dm-only reinforces that by guaranteeing
  no stray [channel:] redirect can override it. A STANDALONE marker (alone on
  its line) is stripped from the delivered text; an INLINE mention is left
  verbatim, because rewriting prose that merely discusses the marker silently
  corrupts owner-facing text. Detection is unaffected — it still matches
  anywhere, so the order-independence guarantee holds. dm-only overrides redirect regardless of marker order;
  it does NOT override a SKIP (a skipped body is delivered nowhere anyway).

  ATTACH markers — anywhere in the body:
    [file: /path]
    [send: /path]
    [attach: /path]
  When found, the bridge extracts the path, runs its own allowlist check,
  uploads the file. The marker is stripped from the delivered text body.

Parse contract:

  parse_markers(text) → ParseResult
    .body      str — text with all known markers stripped
    .actions   list[Action] — what the bridge should do, in priority order:
                 ("skip", reason)         — archive, no delivery
                 ("redirect", channel_id) — deliver to alternate channel
                 ("attach", path)         — bridge runs its own allowlist
                                            check, then uploads

  Skip takes precedence over everything else. If text starts with a skip
  marker, only the skip action is returned (no redirect or attach extraction).

  This is intentional. The bridge's logic is: did we get a skip? If yes,
  archive and return. Otherwise, walk the rest of the action list.
