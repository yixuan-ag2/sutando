# A `## ` heading is not always a question. Two forms are structural, and both

# briefing cannot report different counts for the same file.
#
# Both rules are anchored to SHAPE, not to a keyword appearing somewhere. Earlier
# versions matched the word and each one deleted a live, `Status: open` question:
#
#   `^HELD\b`            -> "## HELD deployment until the owner approves the
#                            migration" is a real ask, not a section shell.

#   inline marker        -> "## Confirm whether the UI should render a [DONE]
#                            badge" is a question ABOUT a badge.
#
# So: an organizer shell is a keyword followed by a separator ("## ACTIVE — …",
# "## FRESH – …", "## HELD: …") — a grouping label, never a sentence. And a
# resolution marker is a bracketed group at the START of the title
# ("## [RESOLVED 2026-07-03] shipped"), never one mentioned mid-sentence.
