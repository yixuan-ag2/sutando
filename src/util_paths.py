"""Resolve personal-asset paths with private-dir-first lookup.

Each Stand has its own identity + avatar. These files are gitignored and
machine-local. Canonical home is `$SUTANDO_MEMORY_DIR/machine-<hostname>/`
so they live with the rest of the per-machine memory under the private
sync repo. Public-workspace fallback is preserved so existing installs
keep working until they migrate.

is honored as a fallback for one release with a deprecation warning on

    keep this, regardless of where Sutando relocated its own config? It skips
    $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR entirely and reads $SOURCE_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (the name
    the note below already gives that location) before the default. Use it ONLY

    A caller who wants the relocated dir wants the default form; collapsing the
    two is the bug sonichi#2629 is about, where the official discord plugin
    wrote approval markers to the stock home and the bridge read the relocated
    one, so confirmations were silently never sent.
