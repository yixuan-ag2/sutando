"""Resolve personal-asset paths with private-dir-first lookup.

Each Stand has its own identity + avatar. These files are gitignored and
machine-local. Canonical home is `$SUTANDO_MEMORY_DIR/machine-<hostname>/`
so they live with the rest of the per-machine memory under the private
sync repo. Public-workspace fallback is preserved so existing installs
keep working until they migrate.

The env var `SUTANDO_MEMORY_DIR` is the canonical name per the 2026-05-18
workspace-design RFC (#858, Decision 2). The legacy name `SUTANDO_PRIVATE_DIR`
is honored as a fallback for one release with a deprecation warning on
every read (cron environments miss startup-only warnings, so logging at
every resolution is intentional).

Usage:
    from util_paths import personal_path
    si = personal_path("stand-identity.json")
    avatar = personal_path("stand-avatar.png")  # also tries assets/ in public
