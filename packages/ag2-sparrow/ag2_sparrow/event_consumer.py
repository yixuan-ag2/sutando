"""event_consumer — drain the durable EventInbox into the Core's attention (AWP P1).

P0 gets events durably into the local inbox; P1 gets the Core to actually act on
them. The consumer reads UNCONSUMED events oldest-first and routes each through a
HANDLER (the attention layer), then marks them consumed. Handlers are the
observe / record / react / taskify modes — this module ships **taskify**: batch N
meaningful events into ONE task file in tasks/, which the existing Core task
watcher then processes through the normal path (so no new Core runtime wiring).

Trust boundary (sonichi/sutando#2292 P1-1, carried here): a promoted task is
`access_tier: ambient` — NEVER owner. Its body is an OBSERVATION of room activity
(anyone in the room could have produced it), so it must not authorize privileged
ops; the Core fails it closed to the sandbox path. priority=low, model_hint=
efficient, and a deterministic id keyed on the source event_ids (idempotent — a
re-drained batch resolves to the same task file, never a duplicate).
