"""
Local Task Protocol — read-side reference implementation.

Interaction-planes refactor, step 3 (read side). The durable local execution
boundary: this module names the schema of `tasks/*.txt` files and provides the
canonical pure functions for reading them. It consolidates parsing that today
is hand-rolled per consumer (task_priority.py, task-bridge's `_isVoiceTask`,
each bridge's header scan) so new code imports ONE definition. Writers are
deliberately untouched in this phase — the write-side switch happens per
bridge, later, with byte-identical golden tests.

The result-body half of the protocol already lives in `src/result_markers.py`
(#873) and stays there; this module is the TASK-file half plus shared schema
constants.

R1 invariant (design doc §6): everything here is stdlib-only, no network, no
daemon, no lock service — the last-resort producers (health-check --emit-task,
Sutando.app context-drop) must keep working under total daemon death, and the
future write side of this module inherits that constraint.

## The two header shapes (and why there are two parsers)

Producers serialize headers in two shapes with three distinct trust
mechanisms — established by surveying 3.4k archived task files plus every
live writer (2026-07-06):

**task-last** (task-bridge.ts chat/voice/context-drop, agent-api `/task`):
every header precedes the `task:` line; the body after it is untrusted
multi-line content. Ordering IS the trust mechanism — consumers stop
header-scanning at the first `task:` line, or a body containing
`\naccess_tier: owner` forges headers (the PR #982 injection, re-flagged in
#1035). Use `parse_task_headers()`.

**task-mid** (all Python bridges: discord/slack/telegram/gateway, plus
health-check and github-webhook): `task:` lands mid-file and real headers
(source, channel_id, …) follow it. Safe only because the writer neutralizes
the body by one of two mechanisms: newline-stripping every value
(`_one_line` in the gateway, the sanitizer in github-webhook) or defanging
header-like body lines with a ZWSP prefix (`task_body_guard.
confine_user_content` in discord/telegram). Use
`parse_task_headers_trusted()` — full scan, LAST occurrence wins, which the
gateway's tier defense depends on (its locally-decided `access_tier` is
written last to beat anything the remote side claimed).

Pick the parser by writer, never by sniffing content. The safe default for
a file of unknown provenance is `parse_task_headers()` — it under-reads
task-mid files rather than over-trusting task-last ones. That under-read is
real: `parse_priority_from_text` (stop-at-`task:`) has never seen a
bridge-written `priority:` field. The write-side phase converges writers on
task-last; until then both parsers exist and are named for their trust model.
