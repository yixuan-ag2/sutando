"""
remote-gateway-bridge.py — generic client that bridges a REMOTE task gateway to the
local Sutando file queue, so the local core processes remote tasks unchanged.

This is the OPEN, provider-agnostic half of the "agent as a service" design: a
gateway service holds the platform connection and
exposes a tiny HTTP protocol; this client pulls *your* tasks down into the local
`tasks/` queue and pushes results back up. No provider-specific logic lives here
— that's the gateway's job.

Full spec: docs/remote-gateway-protocol.md

  Protocol (versioned, Bearer-auth):
  GET  {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/tasks?wait=<sec>
       → 200 {"tasks": [ {<task fields...>}, ... ]}   (long-poll; [] on timeout)
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/tasks/<task-id>/ack
       → body {"id": "<task-id>"}  → 200 on accepted
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/results
       → body {"id": "<task-id>", "body": "<result text>"}  → 200 on accepted
  POST {REMOTE_TASK_URL}/v1/heartbeat
       → body {"client": "...", "inflight": N, ...}  → 200 on accepted

Each task object uses the same schema Sutando's other bridges write, so this
client just serializes it to `tasks/task-<id>.txt` and the core handles it like
any Discord/Telegram/Slack task. When `results/task-<id>.txt` appears, its body
is POSTed back and the result file is archived. Ack/heartbeat are best-effort:
if an older gateway returns 404/405, the client keeps working against the
original pull/result protocol.

Config (env / .env):
  REMOTE_TASK_TOKEN      the onboarding string — the ONLY required setting
                        (combined "https://<gateway>|<secret>" or a bare secret)
  REMOTE_TASK_URL        gateway base URL (only needed with a bare secret)
  REMOTE_TASK_URL/_TOKEN  legacy aliases
  REMOTE_TASK_PROVIDER  label used for the task `source:` field (default "remote")
  REMOTE_TASK_POLL_WAIT long-poll seconds (default 25)

Stdlib only (urllib) — no new dependencies.

# Prefer IPv4 for gateway/relay connections. The relay host (e.g. chat.ag2.space)
# publishes AAAA records, but some hosts have IPv6 black-holed at the network
# (the SYN is silently dropped, not refused). Python's getaddrinfo returns v6
# first, so each fresh urllib connection — this bridge opens one per long-poll
# AND one per outbound send, with no keep-alive — hangs on the dead v6 address
# for the full TCP connect timeout (~26s observed) before falling back to v4,
# which connects in <1s. That timeout is added to EVERY inbound message and
# EVERY reply, so the owner sees ~26s each way and messages look dropped. We
# filter getaddrinfo to A (v4) records for the gateway host so the dead v6 path
# is never tried; we keep the original result when there is no v4 address, so a
# genuinely v6-only destination still resolves. Opt out with
# REMOTE_GATEWAY_ALLOW_IPV6=1 (hosts with working v6 lose nothing either way).
# DNS resolution has NO native timeout: getaddrinfo blocks the caller until the
# resolver answers or the OS gives up (which can be minutes, or never on a
# captive portal / dropped link mid-query). urllib's socket timeout covers
# connect+read but NOT name resolution — so without a bound, a hung resolver
# wedges the long-poll loop indefinitely with no "reconnecting" status write and
# no self-recovery (observed on a tester's machine 2026-07-25: gateway process
# stuck, DNS for space.ag2.space failing, UI showing "reconnecting" forever).

    `connect` writes the relay token to the channel .env, but not every launcher

    that matters: its supervisor spawns the core (and the gateway window) with a
    fixed env whitelist, and the window sources the .env only once at start — so
    if connect writes the token after that (or the export step is skipped), the
    bridge sees an empty token and never connects (every new desktop-only user
    can reproduce this). Read the file directly so the bridge connects regardless
    of who launched it, and so a bridge already looping when connect wrote the

# ── inbound media fetch (owner screenshots, file uploads) ────────────────────
# A gateway can hand the task body a media MARKER instead of raw bytes:
#   [<tag>: <url> mime=<m> name=<f> size=<n> kind=<msgtype>] <caption>
# `<url>` is typically unreachable for the core as-is (a homeserver media URL
# behind authenticated-media, or a gateway media-proxy URL). We resolve it here —
# where the gateway bearer already lives — download the bytes to a local file,
# and rewrite the marker to `[File attached: <path>]` (the inbound convention
# the Discord/Telegram bridges use) so the core just reads a local path with
# zero remote creds.
#
# Auth is picked by the URL:
#   • URL under REMOTE_TASK_URL → fetched with the gateway bearer we already hold
#   • a Matrix `/_matrix/media/...` URL → upgraded to the authenticated
#     MSC3916 client route and fetched with REMOTE_MEDIA_HS_TOKEN (a homeserver
#     access token), if configured
#   • any other https URL → fetched with NO credentials
# Authenticated fetches do NOT follow redirects (a gateway-controlled URL must
# not be able to bounce our bearer to a third-party host). Drop-in safe: no
# token / fetch error / oversize → the marker is left untouched.
#
# The marker tag is configurable (REMOTE_MEDIA_MARKER, slug chars only) so a
# provider-specific gateway can keep its existing marker name without this repo
# carrying provider strings.

# an instruction. We strip it here so it never reaches the agent as body content

# reaped (freshness like state/cores/<host>.alive). FAIL-OPEN by design: any
# lock-layer error → poll anyway (a lock bug must never silence task delivery;
