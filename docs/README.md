# Sutando documentation

This is the canonical map of Sutando's maintained documentation. Start with the
path that matches what you are trying to do; feature-specific agent procedures
remain colocated in `skills/*/SKILL.md` and are linked rather than duplicated.

Machine-readable ownership and lifecycle metadata lives in
[`catalog.json`](catalog.json). CI checks that every Markdown document under
`docs/` is listed here and in the catalog, and that local Markdown links resolve.

## Start here

- [Configure a workspace](workspace-config.md) — defaults, overrides, and
  resolver APIs.
- [Run Codex as the core](codex-core.md) — core selection, setup, and rollback.
- [Use built-in tools](built-in-tools.md) — authoritative capability catalog.
- [External runtime dependencies](runtime-dependencies.md) — what must be
  installed, what only a feature needs, and what to vendor when embedding.

## Guides and examples

- [Community use cases](community-use-cases/README.md)
  - [Self-healing install](community-use-cases/self-healing-install.md)
- [Set up automatic wire-list regeneration](regen-wire-list-setup.md)

## Operations

- [Release process and migrations](release-process.md)
- [Workspace sync across machines](workspace-sync.md)
- [Per-host workspace convention](workspace-hosts-convention.md)
- [Per-host carried-path rules](workspace-per-host-paths.md)
- [State-sync allowlist design](state-sync-allowlist.md)
- [Testing and coverage](testing-coverage.md)
- [Voice-agent test framework](voice-agent-test-framework.md)

## Reference

- [Host CLI bindings](host-cli-bindings.md)
- [Remote gateway protocol](remote-gateway-protocol.md)
- [Slack bridge](slack-bridge.md)
- [Generated `src/` module map](src-map.md)
- [Workspace operational contract](workspace-contract.md)

## Architecture and decisions

- [Architecture boundaries](architecture-boundaries.md)
- [Claude Code hook contract v1](runtime/claude-hook-contract-v1.md)
- [Workspace two-space model](workspace-design.md)
- [Pointer Teacher design](pointer-teacher-design.md)
- [ADR 0001: Pointer Teacher brain](adr/0001-pointer-teacher-brain.md)

## Documentation contract

Each `docs/**/*.md` file must:

1. be linked from this index;
2. have one entry in `docs/catalog.json` with `title`, `audience`, `status`,
   `canonical_for`, and `last_verified`;
3. use relative links for repository-local content;
4. name one canonical document for a policy or contract instead of copying the
   same normative text into multiple files.

Allowed lifecycle statuses are:

- `canonical` — authoritative for the named contract or policy;
- `active` — maintained guidance or reference, but not the sole authority;
- `draft` — under discussion and not operational policy;
- `historical` — retained for context and not current guidance.

`last_verified` is an ISO date when the document was checked against current
behavior. It may be `null` for legacy documents not yet verified under this
contract; release preparation must surface and resolve `null` for every document
affected by that release.
