# Unit-test coverage gate — enforce >= 95% coverage on CHANGED Python lines.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Runs every standalone Python test (tests/**/*.test.py — same discovery
#      as ci.yml) under coverage.py instrumentation.
#   2. Prints the whole-tree coverage report (informational — the visibility
#      that lets us ratchet the global floor up over time).
#   3. Gates: `diff-cover` compares coverage.xml against the base branch and
#      FAILS if less than 95% of the added/changed executable Python lines
#      are exercised by the suite.
#   4. Writes coverage-summary.md (the numbers + per-file misses) for the PR
#      comment posted by .github/workflows/coverage-comment.yml, and appends
#      it to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when running in Actions.
#
# Why diff coverage and not a global floor: the tree's historical global
# coverage is far below 95% (large untested legacy surface: bridges, GUI
# automation, installers). A global 95% floor would hard-red every PR on
# day one and block all merges. The diff gate applies the full 95% bar to
# every line of NEW code, which converges the tree toward the target
# without freezing development. Flip GLOBAL_FLOOR on once the tree gets
# there (see docs/testing-coverage.md).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/coverage-gate.sh                 # gate vs origin/main
#   BASE_REF=<ref> bash scripts/coverage-gate.sh  # gate vs another base
#   COVERAGE_GATE_FAIL_UNDER=90 bash scripts/coverage-gate.sh  # override bar
#
# Deps (dev-only, mirrors detect-secrets handling in ci.yml):
#   python3 -m pip install coverage diff-cover
# Locally on PEP-668 (Homebrew) pythons, use a venv and put it on PATH.
