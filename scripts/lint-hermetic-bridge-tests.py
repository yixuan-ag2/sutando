"""Sutando lint: a test that imports a bridge MUST isolate CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR first.

WHY
---
`src/discord-bridge.py` (and the slack/telegram siblings) resolve channel config at
**module level**, so the work happens during `exec_module`, before a test can intervene:

    src/discord-bridge.py:205   channels_env = claude_home_path("channels", "discord", ".env")
    src/discord-bridge.py:555   ACCESS_FILE  = channel_access_path("discord")

`channel_access_path()` reads `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and falls back to the LEGACY real-home
`~/.claude/channels/<ch>/access.json` when the canonical path is missing. A test that does
not set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` therefore inherits whatever the developer happens to have, and
the symptom differs per machine:

  * clean box     -> legacy fallback + `[util_paths] DEPRECATION: using legacy ...`
  * operator box  -> silently imports that operator's REAL channel allowlist

Verified 2026-07-30 by re-running the import with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` popped from the env:
`ACCESS_FILE = /Users/<operator>/.claude/channels/discord/access.json`. Green everywhere,
trustworthy nowhere. Setting a bot token alone does NOT help — that only stops the `.env`
read, never the access resolution.

THE FIX a test must apply (before `exec_module`):

    os.environ["CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"] = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="ccd-...")
    _cfg = Path(os.environ["CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"]) / "channels" / "discord"
    _cfg.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    (_cfg / "access.json").write_text('{"allowFrom": []}')

DETECTION NOTES (all learned the hard way)
------------------------------------------
1. Detection is **AST-based, not regex**, and order-aware. Two earlier text-scanning drafts
   were bypassable, both demonstrated by qingyun on #2429:
     * an assignment-SHAPED comment (`# os.environ["CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"] = ...`) matched the
       regex — comments never reach the AST;
     * a REAL assignment placed AFTER `exec_module()` matched too — isolation that executes
       after the import is useless, because the module-level resolution already ran.
   Isolation now counts only when an executable assignment precedes the bridge import.
   This is not theoretical: `tests/bridge-env-token-perms.test.py` sets CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR at
   line 179 but calls exec_module at line 124, and the regex draft called it clean.
   An unparseable file is treated as a VIOLATION — a file that cannot be analysed is not
   proven clean.
2. Recognize **post-import mitigation**. `tests/slack-bridge-tier-map.test.py` reassigns
   `mod.ACCESS_FILE` to a temp path after `exec_module`, deliberately, so its destructive
   write/unlink cannot touch the operator's real file. The import still resolves host config,
   so it is not clean — but it is not the same defect, and hard-failing the one author who
   thought about this is how lints get switched off. It reports as MITIGATED (non-fatal).

Usage:
  python3 scripts/lint-hermetic-bridge-tests.py           # scan whole tree (report + gate)
  python3 scripts/lint-hermetic-bridge-tests.py --diff    # scan only files added/modified vs BASE_REF
  python3 scripts/lint-hermetic-bridge-tests.py --list    # print current violators, exit 0

Exit 1 ONLY when a test outside KNOWN_UNISOLATED violates. A KNOWN_UNISOLATED entry that no
longer violates is reported as a NOTE, not a failure — hard-failing there is a footgun: the
moment a PR fixes a listed file, main goes red until someone edits this script. (Found while
testing this lint: #2428 fixes tests/bridge-audit-wiring.test.py, and a fatal stale-check
would have reddened main on its merge.)

#     text. _code_strings() now selects structurally, so the entry went stale and
#     the stale-entry check (correctly) failed the run until it was dropped.
#   + ADDED tests/discord-access-backup.test.py — a REAL hole, not a false positive:
#     it builds channels/discord/access.json under a mkdtemp inside a class fixture
#     while exec_module runs at MODULE level, so the import still resolves against
#     the developer's real config. It landed in #2358, after the 2026-07-30 baseline
#     below was measured, which is why it is absent from it. Grandfathered rather
#     than fixed here: repairing another PR's test is a second concern, and
#     CONTRIBUTING forbids bundling it. Follow-up tracked separately. Mini's shared-helper
# migration removes these; the stale-entry check below forces the list to shrink.
# Measured on origin/main (2026-07-30, post-#2428-merge) with the AST classifier. The count rose

    Two mechanisms are recognized, because both really occur in this repo:
      * `spec.loader.exec_module(mod)` — the importlib path;
      * `exec(src, ns.__dict__)` / `exec(src, ns)` — reading the bridge with
        read_text() and exec'ing it into a namespace.

    Recognizing only exec_module was a scope hole, not a strictness choice: a file
    loading the bridge via exec() returned None ("out of scope") and was never checked
    at all. qingyun and john both hit it on #2429 with
    tests/discord-bridge-public-notice-suppression.test.py, which execs the bridge and
    seeds only `.env` — so channel_access_path()'s legacy fallback still resolved the
    operator's real access.json at import. Out-of-scope is a SILENT PASS, which is the
    worst verdict a gate can give.
