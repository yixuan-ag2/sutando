"""Post a coordination message from this bot to the #bot2bot channel.

Usage:
    python3 skills/bot2bot-post/post.py [--to <peer|id>] <kind> <text>
    python3 skills/bot2bot-post/post.py claim "refactor X, ETA 20m"
    python3 skills/bot2bot-post/post.py --to pro ping "your take on the WIRE topic?"
    python3 skills/bot2bot-post/post.py --to lucy opinion "disagreement axis below"
    python3 skills/bot2bot-post/post.py done "shipped PR #472"

Kinds: claim | blocked | done | ping | opinion
Peers (for --to): a name from ~/.claude/channels/discord/peers.json, or a raw numeric id

The target channel ID is read from `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/discord/access.json`:
entries tagged with `{"role": "bot2bot", ...}` in `groups` are candidates. We
pick the first such channel. If none is tagged, we fall back to the first
group whose value is just `true` (legacy convention), or error out.

Recipient targeting: pass `--to <peer|id>` to @-mention a specific peer. This
is the correct way when more than one peer exists — the old auto-resolve
assumed a SINGLE other bot and silently mis-fired otherwise (it mentioned Mini
for a post addressed to Pro, 2026-06-06; on 2026-07-29 both Pro and Mini
mispinged Air the same way, each stray ping triggering the target's team-tier
auto-refusal). Without `--to`, the peer id is auto-resolved from the bot2bot
CHANNEL's `allowFrom` (excluding this bot, via GET /users/@me) ONLY when
exactly one peer exists; with 2+ peers the post goes out WITHOUT a mention
(peers ingest the channel anyway) and a stderr NOTE says to use `--to`. The
resulting `<@id>` mention, when present, makes the receiving bot's bridge
process the post as a task (discord-bridge.py line 244 exception).

SCOPE GUARD (2026-07-27): bot2bot-post only ever posts to the one bot2bot channel
(resolved from access.json's `role: bot2bot` tag — NOT hardcoded). A `--to <X>`
where X is NOT a member of that channel is REFUSED with a loud error, instead of
silently posting where X will never see it (the dead-letter, and the
bot-vs-human-owner id mix-up — a bot and its owner are different ids). Where to
route a message that ISN'T bot2bot coordination is the caller's judgment (it
depends on the message + recipient + topic-home), so the guard does NOT
prescribe a destination — it just refuses and says the recipient isn't a member.
